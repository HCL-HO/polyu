## Question 8
An agile team is developing a new customer engagement platform for an eCommerce company. During a meeting between the product owner and the CEO of the company, the stakeholder hopes that a certain set of AI related features should be deployed to the production by the end of December as the competitor has launched similar features recently. After initial estimation, the agile team expects that it requires three more months to complete the related user stories. According to the video "Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell", which of the following is the BEST option to be adopted? 


- [ ] The team should negotiate with the stakeholder to delay the release of the system by three months to deliver the required features without compromising quality 
- [ ] The team should set a more aggressive target to release the system in December with the required features. The team should recruit more team members to deliver the required features on time. 
- [ ] The team should set a more aggressive target to release the system in December with the required features. By setting a more aggressive target, the productivity of the team members will be increased. 
- [ ] The team should target to release the system in December and negotiate with the stakeholders with reduced scope so that the system can be delivered on time.

## Question 14

A software development team working on a mission critical web application has to automate the process of building, testing, and deployment. When a developer makes a code change, it is pushed to the version control system, which triggers an automated deployment pipeline. The pipeline first runs automated unit tests to ensure that the code change does not introduce any new bugs or issues. If the tests pass, the code change is built and packaged into a deployable software package. The package is then automatically deployed to a production-like testing environment where it undergoes further testing and validation.
