## Analysis Report of Spotify

### Abstract
*Spotify* is a digital music streaming application that offers various music genres, artists and albums. This report presents an analysis of Spotify. By introducing the background of the application and its advantages, this report highlights how Spotify's user interface effectively incorporates Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) techniques to provide an enjoyable user experience. Besides, it identifies the main disadvantages of Spotify's design and suggests possible future improvements.

### Introduction
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has become increasingly important in developing software, applications, and so forth. HCI design is the process of creating products that are intuitive and easy to use for users. With the emergence of streaming services, the need for HCI design has become even more critical.

Spotify is one of the most common music streaming applications, with over 456 million monthly active users worldwide (Spotify, 2023) and been increasing which is allowed users to access over 80 million songs, albums, and artists from around the world. It provided two versions, including free and paid premium versions. Compared to other mainstream music streaming applications such as Apple Music and YouTube Music. Spotify offers a much more extensive selection of music for its users, with access to major label releases and even smaller independent labels.

This report will examine the key features of Spotify and how they contribute to its excellent user experience.

### Analysis Details
The main contribution of Spotify is without boundaries, offering millions of songs featuring well-known artists and independent artists worldwide. People from different countries with diverse tastes can fulfil demand and share their culture through the platform. Furthermore, on top of that, it also offers social media abilities of "Follow" to enable the user to interact with others, know their interest, and keep up with new releases from friends and family members. Therefore, it offers a wide range of features to help users explore new music and easily share their favourite songs with friends. The application is the ability to search for different music information. Users can create and share their playlists. Discover new songs based on their listening habits, and explore various genres. The application also provides users personalized recommendations based on their search, favourite and so forth to find new music they enjoy lightly.

Moreover, providing an enjoyable and intuitive user experience is indispensable. The user interface, which is well-designed and easy to navigate, is organized into several sections, such as the main music library as a home page, playlists, albums, and the discovery section for users to explore new music. Besides, the navigation bar at the page's top allows users to switch
between sections quickly. Therefore, suitable for even novice users based on the simple design. Furthermore, another critical aspect of HCI design is accessibility and inclusion. The application has been optimized for use with screen readers and is compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). (Spotify Design, 2019) It is friendly for users with limited mobility or dexterity. The wide selection of music and podcasts ensures something for everyone.


Despite its advantages, Ads will be a main disadvantage in the free version, which can sometimes be intrusive. It will be stopping or muting the audio every few minutes to play a promotional sound bite from a sponsored label or artist. It could be particularly distracting if users try to relax by listening to music for leisure activities such as studying or reading. However, do not consider the version of the application. The recommendation algorithms may cause glitchy user experiences. Some users complain that their recommended playlists are inaccurate and unreflective of what they usually listen to. Besides, users may accidentally listen to a podcast they are not interested in, but the podcast will still be included in their recommendations. (Spotify Community, 2022) These will reduce the user experience.

### Conclusion
Spotify's HCI design is impressive in terms of its intuitive user interface, interactive features, and usability features. It provides a wide selection of music and podcasts, allowing users to explore different genres and artists. The user interface is supported users with limited mobility or dexterity. However, ads and inaccurate recommendation algorithms are a problem for some users. To provide a better user experience, it should continue to improve its algorithm and reduce the number of ads in the free version of the application.
