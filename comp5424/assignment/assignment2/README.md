# COMP5424 Individual Assignment 2

The sensory conflict theory is one of the widely accepted theory that explains cybersickness. In this individual assignment, you need to answer five questions after reading the journal article titled “Floor-vibration VR: Mitigating Cybersickness Using Whole-body Tactile Stimuli in Highly Realistic Vehicle Driving Experiences”, which can be downloaded from Learn or https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3067773. You are highly recommended to review Lecture 2 – Perception, Cognition, and Psychology of XR and Lecture 5 – XR Applications Design and Development before start working on this individual assignment.

## Q1. Use your own words to summarise the major findings and limitations of the study reported in this article.

(Use the bullet point format and use no more than 200 words)

Major findings:

- The user as a passenger of the car in the virtual environment for reduce the level of cybersickness, which can provide minimally matched floor vibration. It is better than no vibration based on findings of research paper about differences for V and N groups for the variables change in Delta-SSQ Oculomotor score and change in GSR. 
- It will not influence the level of presence in Virtual Environment if utilize floor vibration, based on not strongly differences for V and N groups which presented by MEC-SPQ data.

Major limitations:

- Some participants in group N used their own methods to reducing cybersickness. It may decrease overall of cybersickness for the group, affected the results and it may lead to some hidden negative effects in the data.
- No a measurable method to determine if vibration is actually stimulated the vestibular system. The system shown in the research paper just get a minimal approximation of the missing vibration input to the vestibular system.
- Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only 22 participants is enrolled it reduced the statistical power of analyses.

## Q2. Use your own words to describe what cybersickness is. What are its differences from motion sickness (from the perspectives of their definitions and the explanatory theories)?

(Use no more than 300 words)

The Cybersickness is a subtype of motion sickness. It will felt a touch of lightheadedness or nausea when using smartphone or computer, even accompanied by immersion in virtual reality. In the virtual reality, based on sensory-mismatch theory, a mismatch between visual stimuli and vestibular or proprioceptive feedback is the most frequent cause of cybersickness. Also, additional factors contributing with hardware-dependent (frame rate, flicker, etc) and content-dependent. For example: it possible caused by disruptions in the balance between visual, vestibular (orientation, balance, and acceleration), and proprioceptive (body movement) stimuli in 3D environment.

Cybersickness and motion sickness both of that will feelings of dizziness, nausea, headaches or etc  and it has many similarities but some key differences as well. Regarding the motion sickness, it can be triggered by experiences in real-world, caused by conflicting vestibular and oculomotor signals sent to the brain related to perceived movement versus actual movement experienced by the body, such as traveling by boat, airplane, or vehicle. On the other hand, Cybersickness doesn’t involve actual movement and contains conflicts of visual and vestibular senses in VR. More details is described in past paragraph about why Cybersickness occurred. Furthermore, due to a lack of familiarity with such an artificial environment (such as being able to fly, play with differnet type of object, etc) in VE the users will more easily to feels cybersickness when conflict with  the body's instinctive movements.

Overall, cybersickness and motion sickness have some common symptoms, but the underlying causes and explanatory theories is different.


## Q3. Why is the floor vibration approach is believed to be able to mitigate cybersickness? Use your own words to summaries the rationales.

(Use no more than 200 words)

The floor vibration approach is believed to mitigate cybersickness. It is because there will be different ramps on the road, centrifugal force when turning, and so on when we take a vehicle or other equipment. The floor vibration tries to imitate the situation in the real world. This sensation stimulates the vestibular system and provides a sense of balance, which can work with visual and other sensory input provides a more immersive experience as users feel like they are in the presence of a virtual object rather than just viewing it on a screen. It can reduces the discrepancy between what is being seen visually and felt physically, which has been associated with cybersickness. Moreover, it will be better compare with no vibration method, because try to solve the feeling imbalance between real world and virtual environment for user.

## Q4. As described in the article, the skin tone of the avatar that a participant embodied has a skin tone that was “interpolated between White Caucasian and Black African based roughly on participant skin tone” (p. 2673). Why do you think such design choice is important in the context of the study reported in the article? Can you describe a virtual reality application that can also benefit from matching the avatar’s skin tone to its user’s skin tone?

(Use no more than 400 words)
Because our brain forms the connection based on explicit and implicit memory associated with the actual body (Fuchs, 2012) to let humans notice real body features such as colour, texture, etc. Therefore, the researchers need to measure the effect of real body cues on virtual body ownership. Virtual body ownership is a feeling of ownership over a virtual body through the manipulation of perceptual cues. It can be used to create immersive experiences that feel more realistic. It is a form of embodiment, which mean that people's perceptions will be shifted to the virtual environment, and behaviours will be as if they were entirely in tune with the avatar being played on a screen. Also, concerning politics, an important topic is whether experiencing another person's skin colour causes racially biased changes. Indeed, skin colour is a visual trait that powerfully activates stereotyped knowledge and bias (Groom et al., 2009). we have no way of knowing whether participants discriminated against other races. Combining the above factors, including low immersive and personal political orientation, can decrease the data validity. Besides, the research is located in New Zealand, and as a result, interpolated between White Caucasians and Black Africans based roughly on participant skin tone, which is a suitable design in the research.

About the VR Game, named “Blade & Sorcery: Nomad”. The selling point of this game is to allow the player to select a personal fighting style: mighty warrior, ranger, or so on in a dream. It is very focused on Virtual body ownership. When the game starts, it allows character customisation, including skin colour, hair, etc., to improve the immersion in the VE. But in the early stage of the game, not many skin tones can choose. Thus, some people developed a mod that provides more skin tones to let the character in the game be more like themselves. So that by having avatars whose skin tones match the user, they feel more connected to their avatars to express themselves more authentically and have a better sense of identity to render these stories and facts into a more meaningful representation visually. Figure 1 shows the positive comment of the MOD on YouTube.

## Q5. In Section 3.3, the authors gave very detailed specifications of the hardware and the design of the virtual reality scene used for the study. Do you think it is necessary? Give your reasons.

(Use no more than 300 words)

Yes, it is necessary.

First of all, being able to replicate an experiment with precision is paramount. It is because researchers can rerun experiments as closely as possible. They will have more confidence that their results are reliable and reproducible, and guaranteeing the accuracy enables other researchers to replicate and validate the results. It will reduce researcher bias, increase generalizability, and enhance our understanding of the research topic. Besides, anyone can replicate or build upon the experiment for education or improvement.

Secondly, the part of crucial factor in virtual reality experiments is hardware. The quality and type of hardware used can largely influence the participant’s experience during the experiment. Thus, affecting data collection accuracy. That is why important for authors to provide detailed computer hardware and design of the floor-vibration platform so that future studies can consider these variables correctly when investigating similar research questions. Besides, there are many variables in the designed virtual environment, such as lighting models, content selection, etc. authors provide useful specific details about their design choices. It can let other researchers know more details about the experiment to reproduce or test different versions of the same experiment to identify any potential biases or sources of error that may have been present within the original experimental setup. Ultimately, these details will help improve the quality and reliability of future research using similar methods. 

In summary, the authors providing detailed specifications on hardware and virtual reality scene design can guarantee better accuracy when reproducing findings from the original study, enabling additional replications conducted by future researchers to ensure reliability. Besides, I believe the technology we have today is combined with the research results of the predecessors, and the current research results are piled up. The researcher will spend much time rebuilding the experiment if not detailed.
