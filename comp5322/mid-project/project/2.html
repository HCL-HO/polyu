                                        <h3>Description</h3>
                                        <p>The report will describe more about the RQSW system, including four major
                                            parts: Literature review, system requirements, a proposed design, and
                                            implementations. The literature review evaluated existing literature on
                                            serverless architectures, transformer systems such as BERT, and
                                            Client-Side-Rendering and Server-side-Rendering. Besides, the system
                                            requirements included deeply listing the functional and non-functional
                                            requirements. In addition, the proposed design contains use cases, use case
                                            diagrams, database schema, sequence diagram, architecture design, and the
                                            system interface design. Furthermore, the about the part of the
                                            implementation, it is details of the testing procedure and the problem that
                                            occurred. The critical review and Suggestions for extensions to the project
                                            will be contained in this report.</p>
                                        <p>Therefore, the RQSW is proposed which is the cloud-based platform that allows
                                            the teacher to create the answer book for the quiz or exam. The answer book
                                            included the model answer of the question, etc. The system will grade the
                                            student's work or sort the question based on created answer book when the
                                            teacher uploads the student answer sheets. The system will generate the
                                            report to the teacher for reference to the performance of the student works.
                                            The system is also allowed to publish the answer sheet to the student which
                                            will send the graded result to the student via email. The student can
                                            download the result by email to reduce the time of distribution.</p>
