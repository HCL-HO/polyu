# COMP5511 Project

## Objective

The purpose of the group project is to provide students with an opportunity to apply what they have learned in the course and work as a team to do in-depth study.Students are expected to identify and quantify a problemabout AIbased on a real dataset. To solve the problem, students need to apply at  least oneAI algorithm  or  method learned from this course,demonstrate why and how the methods help to solve the problem, and  show  the  results  and  model  performance.  The final deliverable is a group-based written report(20%) plus a class presentation(20%).

## Project Requirements
- Each group consists of 3 to 4 students
- Group members are expected to have different backgrounds, and the contributions of different members in your group should be marked in the final report.
- At least one Al algorithm or method from this course should be applied to analyze the dataset, and
more than one algorithm or method are encouraged.
- Performance of your methods needs to be evaluated and discussed by model evaluation guidelines.
- Experiment settings, results interpretation, hyper-parameter tuning, limitations should be included
to demonstrate your comprehensive understanding of the methods.

## Deliverables

1. Class presentation:
   - Mode: presentation (Time: 15-20 mins)
   -  Please submit a softcopy of the presentation slides before the date of the presentation.
   -  The presentation section should be live. All the team members are expected to be present in-person in the class or online.
2. Written report
   - Due time: Nov 14. 2022 (late submission is not accepted)
   - Format: no more than 15 pages, including all the contents (cover page, executive summary, text, tables, figures and references). 12 font size. 15 or double line space.
   - One *softcopy* submission for each group: *Blackboard Assessments - Group project*
   - Plagiarism check will be conducted by Turnitin report. Turnitin similarity index should be < 15%. Turnitin originality reports for the first submission of your paper will be generated around 15 to 30 minutes. However, it may take more than 24 hours to generate the reports again for re-submission. Make sure you have enough time to do it before the deadline.
   - You are to prepare a report that describes what you did. The report should be typed and it will preferably be organized to include:
     - a cover page with title of group project, group members' name, student ID and lecture time.
     - Include an executive summary at the beginning of the report.
     - An Introduction that describes thee problem that you are facing. to give a short illustration about what problem you want to address, what dataset you use, and what AI methods can be used to solve the problem. The contributions of different members in your group should be included in the end of this section.
     - Describe each step in your algorithm and method process that you perform and explain your choice of transformation techniques and algorithms, etc.
     - If there is a requirement for parameters of different algorithms to be tuned, explain how you arrive at particular values.
     - Discuss any modeling assumptions as well as practical "hacks" you made in your model.
     - Report the results of your tests and performance assessment of the models constructed The results can be presented in terms of classification or prediction accuracy or root mean squared error (RMSEs), speed (FPS) and memory. Investigation of parameter effects will be necessary.
     - Try to interpret the results of your model and provide some theoretical justification why the algorithms of your choice should work.
     - You are required to include references. If you are using information or tools from other sources apart from your own you should reference them. Avoid copying pieces of text from books or papers. If you have to do it, paraphrase and reference it.
     - Provide an appendix with the relevant portions of your code. Provide a list of any external tools that you haveused. Appendix doesn't count in total pages.

## Recommended topics

Kaggle (www.kaggle.com) is a platform for competitions in data modeling and analytics. Companies and researchers post data on Kaggle so that data scientists compete to construct models that best characterize data. There are a number of ways that people can use Kaggle. Submissions for the Kaggle competitions contain lots of codes that can help beginners start with machine learning or data analytics techniques. Beginners can follow instructions to download data, play around with them and try constructing different models as described in different tutorials. For more experienced data analysts. they can attempt more variety of problems. Instead of learning from the tutorials provided, they can learn from other users' scripts. You can also see what kind of tools other data scientists are use and why they use them, how they process the data, what kind of models they use, how parameters are tuned and how good the models perform, how these models areassessed.

The purpose of this course is to ensure that students taking COMP5511 are able to apply what they
learn from the course to address some interest problem in different application domains. Students can
select one set of data from the following 10 sets obtained from Kaggle and use Al algorithms and
methods to address the problem:

For some datasets, you need to split the training and testing datasets. Besides these 10 topics, other interesting topics about Al applications are also encouraged.
