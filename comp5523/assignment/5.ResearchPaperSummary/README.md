## Objectives
In thissummary, you should clearly state the research problem, review the literature on this topic, identify state-of-the-art solutions, unresolved issues, key challenges, and future directions, and preferably discuss your own understanding, thoughts, ideas, questions, or even your proposed solutions for the problem. *Implementation and evaluation are not mandatory*, but if you have some preliminary results, you are *strongly encouraged to include them* within the allowable page limit.

You should aim to demonstrate that you understand the related concepts and approaches to the research problem, and that you have conducted a comprehensive review of relevant literature so you know what has been done thus far and what remains to be done, what works, what doesn’t, and why, and where improvements are needed and how these can be achieved.
