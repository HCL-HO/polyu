The question may have multiple correct answers.

## Question 1

- [ ] The k-nearest neighbor algorithm does more computation during test time than during training.

## Question 2


Which of the following statements is (are) TRUE regarding convolutional neural networks (CNNs)?
		
- [ ] Max pooling is a pooling operation that selects the maximum element from the region of the feature map covered by the filter. Thus, the output after max-pooling layer would be a feature map containing the most prominent features of the previous feature map.
		
- [ ] Pooling layers can reduce the spatial dimensions of the input feature maps, which can be helpful in reducing the computational complexity of the network and preventing overfitting.

- [ ] Canny edge detector uses hysteresis thresholding to avoid streaking.

- [ ] Hough transform can give robust detection under noise and partial occlusion.

- [ ] In Canny edge detection, we will get more continuous edges if we increase the low threshold in hysteresis thresholding.

Which of the following statements is (are) FALSE regarding image gradient and edge detection?

- [ ] An image gradient is a directional change in the intensity or color in an image.

- [ ] The x-derivatives of an image are used to detect horizontal edges of the image.

- [ ] Finite difference (derivative) filters are robust to noise.

- [ ] An optimal edge detector must return one point only for each true edge point.

- [ ] Orthographic projection is the simplest type of projection we have discussed in this course. It consists of merely projecting points in a perpendicular fashion onto the image plane.

- [ ] Perspective projection is a nonlinear projection where 3-D objects are projected on a 2-D plane. It has the effect that distant objects appear smaller than nearer objects.

- [ ] Under perspective projections, any set of parallel lines that are not parallel to the image plane will converge to a vanishing point.
