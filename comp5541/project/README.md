# COMP5541 Group Project

### Note
This group  project  fundamentally  aims  to  enable  all  students  to  have  solid  experience  on tackling more complex and real-world problems using cutting-edge deep learning techniques, and  also  improve collaboration  and  presentation  skills.  In  addition,  innovation  and  critical thinking  are  strongly  encouraged  to  explore  open-ended  questions.  For  example,  every member has the freedom to incorporate new ideaswhich can belearned from other research papersbeyond the given listor completely from their own.

Each group should have 2-3 members and needs tochoose one paper to reproduce.If you want to work independently or team up with more than 3 members, contact mevia Email or Teamswith justifications.

### Paper List:
The  following  research  papers  cover both  classic  andthe  state-of-the-artdeep  learning techniques in recent years.All papers have open-sourced code on GitHub. If you want to work on another paper which is not on the list, contact me with justifications.

2. Neural Discrete Representation Learning, NIPS’17
3. Non-local Neural Networks, CVPR’18

### Submission and Marking Criteria 

#### Submission deadline: 23:59, 27 th Nov. (Late submission will not beaccepted.)

Note: Only oneteam member needs to upload all materials via Teams. Please keep the size of allmaterials as small as possible (less than 100M).

At the beginning of the report, please provide full information of all group members and the contribution of each member.

####  Marking Criteria
a1. Successfully run the code and obtain similarresultswith the original paper in at least one experiment.(25 marks)

a2. The report is well written with a clear structure and content. (25 marks)

a3. The oral presentation is clear and accurately describes the paper and results. (25 marks)

b1.  The  code  is  further  modified  to  improve  the  accuracy,or efficiency,  or  anything  else meaningful.Simply adding more layers or neurons or changing the learning ratewill not be counted unless you havestrong justifications.(8 marks)

b2. The report has an additional in-depth analysis or comparison of the principles/ advantages/ shortcomings of the paper.  (8 marks)

b3. The oral presentationis fluent andincludes extra demos or visualizations about the method or the results. (5 marks)

b4. Anything else that can be justified to improve the project. (4 marks)

##### Notes
1. Please takea screen record to show the code is running correctly. 
2. Successfully running one experiment is the minimal requirement. If the experiment is unable to be conducted, please give concrete reasons.You are allowed to use the released pre-trained models, but you need to fine-tune the models in your experiments.
3. In the report, you need to at least summarize the paper including background and method, and present the (quantitative /qualitative) results you obtained. 
4. Please  submit the  code  (optionally  with  demo/screen  shots/etc..),  report  (<=4pages)  and video presentation (<=6min) as a full package.
